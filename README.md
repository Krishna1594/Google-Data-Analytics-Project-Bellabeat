# Google-Data-Analytics-Project-Bellabeat
To analyze publicly available smart device usage data, gain vital insights on how consumers use smart devices and finally make data-driven decisions that will create growth opportunities for Bellabeat's products and the business.

## The Analysis
### Data Gathering and Storage
Users’ smart-device usage data has been acquired from a public domain through Mobius. This Kaggle dataset contains personal fitness tracker from 31 Fitbit users who consented to the submission of personal tracker data, including minute-level output for physical activity, heart-rate and sleep monitoring. Data has been downloaded to a secure drive of a server with encryption to avoid any breaches. 

The data is available for key personnel only with proper access credentials. The dataset has been stored in the format of “.csv (comma separated values) file” and “.xlsx (spreadsheets) files”.

### Trends: How these can help?
Analysing trends in this data can help us create new themes, applications and even create new ways to help users monitor their health easily. Analysing such trends helps us to improve our products that we already offer; such as new visualization capabilities help users to understand their own data easily, we could devise new products specific for certain category of consumers (not everything is needed is one product). Understanding what user needs is important so that our product just delivers that.

These trends can help marketing strategy team to accurately target customers who need our products.
